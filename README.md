# Attack-of-the-Prequels
This is a 3d Xbox 360 game that I made for my AI and Game Design class my Junior year. In this game, the player controls an X-wing and fights of waves of different types of enemies.

This game was written in C# using Visual Studios, but also required a lot of use of Blender and familiarity with working with 3d models and 3d physics engines.
